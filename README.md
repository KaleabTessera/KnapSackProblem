# KnapSackProblem
In the Knapsack problem, our goal is to find the optimal combination of objects which are bound by a total weight W and which achieve the heighest profit / value (v). The problem can be applied to various real life applications such resource allocation problems.

Two variants of the Knapsack problem are considered. The **Linear Knapsack Problem**, where items have individual weights and values, and the **Quadratic Knapsack Problem** where there is an additional term in the objective functions, which represents the extra profit gained from choosing a particular combo of items (in our case pairs).
